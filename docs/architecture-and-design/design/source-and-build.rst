Source Code Organization and Build System
=========================================

Overview
========

.. todo:: Answer the questions below to help you define your source code organization and build
   process. Some example text is provided. Add or delete text as needed. E.g., not all projects try
   to be platform independent.

.. question:: What are the most important facts that a developer should know about this source code
   organization and build system?

.. It roughly follows the standard proposed in the Tomcat documentation and is very similar to the
.. organization used on many open source projects at the Apache Software Foundation.

.. question:: What are the ranked goals of this source code organization and build system?

.. 1. Separation of files by type
.. 2. Separation of version-controlled files from files generated by the build process
.. 3. Compatibility with standard build processes
.. 4. Platform independence

Key Directories and Files in Developer Working Copies
=====================================================

.. todo:: Describe the purpose of each directory that will appear in a developer's work copy, also
   include any files that are important to the overall structure or build process.

+------+----+-------------+
| Path | VC | Description |
+======+====+=============+
|      |    |             |
+------+----+-------------+

Build Targets
=============

.. todo:: Describe the build targets that developers will use in daily development. The examples
   below should fit most projects.

+--------+-------------+
| Target | Description |
+========+=============+
|        |             |
+--------+-------------+

Build Configuration Options
===========================

+----------+-------------+
| Property | Description |
+==========+=============+
|          |             |
+----------+-------------+

.. These build system properties can be modified by editing the build.properties file.

Source Code Organization and Build System Checklist
===================================================

.. question:: Separation of files by type: Are files separated by type?

.. Yes. Except that application JSP and HTML files are in the same directory, which is convenient
.. because sometimes we change an HTML file to be a JSP file.

.. question:: Separation of version-controlled and non-version controlled files: To what extent has
   this been achieved?

.. It has been achieved. Everything is under version control except for the "build" directory. No step
.. in the build process should create or modify any file in any other directory.

.. question:: Compatibility with standard build processes: To what extent has this been achieved?

.. So far, so good. We can use build.xml files that are very close to the examples that come with Ant.
.. One difference is that we keep our technical documentation under "www" rather than under "docs".
.. Also, we have avoided the use of custom ant tasks.

.. question:: Platform independence: To what extent has this been achieved?

.. We are using Ant, which is itself platform independent. The names of the files and directories
.. should work across platforms because they do not rely on case-sensitive names. We assume that the
.. utility scripts in the "scripts" directory support all needed platforms and we have not created
.. directories for different versions of these files aimed at specific platforms.

.. question:: Have these implementation decisions been communicated to the development team and
   other stakeholders?

.. Yes, everyone understands. Feedback is welcome.
.. No, this is a risk that is noted in the Risk Management section.
