User Needs
==========

.. note:: The statement of user needs documents and explains the actual desires of stakeholders in
   roughly their own words. What they desire is never exactly what the product provides. Documenting
   user needs here, independently from the SRS, helps to keep the SRS precise and makes the tasks of
   verification and validation more effective. This document is not an informal draft of the SRS, it
   is different document with a complementary purpose.
   
Agreed Goals
============

.. todo:: Has there been a clear statement of the overall goal of this project that the stakeholders
   agree to? If so, paste it here or add a hyperlink. If not, you should summarize your
   understanding of the project goals into a brief statement and try to get the stakeholders to
   agree to it. The text below gives three alternative examples, select one, or write your own.

.. We were given an initial project description that is agreed to by all stakeholders.  After several
.. interviews and brainstorming sessions, we have revised project description that has been agreed to
.. by all stakeholders.  There are still a few different (but overlapping) visions of what this project
.. needs to achieve. When a single joint vision is agreed to, it will be hyper-linked from here.

Environment
===========

.. todo:: Briefly describe various aspects of the environment where the software will be used.
   Describe the environment as it is or will be, not what you would wish it to become. The text
   below gives a few examples.

.. question:: What is the system's business environment?

.. Each real estate agent works with a set of potential buyers and sellers. Real estate agents do not
.. share customer data with other agents, because they do not want to share commissions. Information on
.. specific available homes changes daily, and this tool must help them keep up.
.. 
.. Game players may visit several free web sites to find information about teams or "clans". There is
.. usually more information available than they would choose to read, the challenge is in having the
.. most fun with the least effort. This website must be familiar to players who have used other sites,
.. but it must also be better.

.. question:: What is the system's physical environment?

.. This system is a web server that will run on a machine in a co-located data center with 24x7
.. monitoring, UPS, air-conditioning, etc. Users of this system are typically at their offices.
.. 
.. This application runs on hand-held devices that will often be used while the user is walking from
.. one section of the warehouse to another. Lighting is good in that environment, but there are many
.. noises and distractions.

.. question:: What is the system's technology environment (hardware and software)?

.. 60% of game players have machines with P-II or equivalent processors, while 30% have P-I machines,
.. and 10% have less powerful machines. While many users have 17-inch monitors, 15-inch monitors or
.. laptops with 1024x768 resolution are also common.
.. 
.. 65% of game players are using Windows 98 or Me. 30% are using NT, 2000, or XP. The remaining 5% use
.. Mac OS X, Mac OS 9, or Linux.

Stakeholders / Actors
=====================

.. todo:: List and describe the stakeholders for this product. These can be named individuals or
   roles that people play. For each stakeholder, list/rank their key needs. Consider the expected
   technical expertise of the stakeholders and how often they are likely to use the system, as well
   as key strengths, weaknesses, preferences, or other characteristics. Use a greater-than sign to
   indicate inheritance among types of actors.

.. note:: To get information on types of users, you can talk to actual users. You may also want to
   talk to user surrogates (people who work with users), such as domain experts, technical trainers,
   technical support staff, technical writers, supervisors of users, and your own sales and
   marketing department. You can find clues in manuals and marketing materials for competing
   products.

.. All
.. ---
.. 
.. All stakeholders share the following key needs:
.. 
.. 1. Security against abuses by other site visitors
.. 2. Convenient access to the site any time over the Internet
.. 
.. Player
.. ------
.. 
.. Players want to have fun. That means a sense of discovery, challenge, satisfaction, and community.
.. Some players who become involved in clans will spend a few hours a week, while others will spend
.. over 20 hours a week. So, they need new content posted often to keep them interested. Players
.. involved in clans are often power users and have high expectations for the functionality and quality
.. of the site, but they may not have much knowledge of computer science.
.. 
.. Key needs:
.. 
.. 1. Easily find information about clans
.. 2. Keep in touch with members of his/her own clan
.. 3. Understand the date and time of tournament play
.. 4. Easily report cheaters
.. 
.. Player > Advanced player
.. ------------------------
.. 
.. Advanced players seek more challenges to continue the sense of discovery. They tend to play over 20
.. hours a week. They have seen more of the game details, now the need to see the "big picture".
.. 
.. Key needs:
.. 
.. 1. View metrics that compare multiple clans
.. 2. Understand relationships between clans
.. 3. Understand overall schedule of tournaments

Notes from Interviews and Brainstorming
=======================================

.. todo:: Keep a log of your requirements gathering. Paste in notes from any face-to-face or
   telephone conversations with stakeholders or from brainstorming sessions with members of the
   development team. If the communication took place via email, link to it in the archive or paste
   it here.

User Stories
============

.. todo:: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system
   (directly and indirectly) to accomplish a real-world goal. User stories are not use cases: user
   stories are brief (3-5 sentences) paragraphs that describe one specific scenario in concrete
   terms. In this description of user needs, do not make assumptions about details of the system,
   instead focus on the users. Note the source of each user story.

.. Invited-To-Join
.. ---------------
.. 
.. John has gotten pretty good at SuperShooter by playing on public servers about 8 hours a week for
.. the last 3 weeks. John has chatted with Bob about strategies and they have enjoyed some duels. Bob
.. is a member of the RedDawn clan. That clan plays a tournament on a private server Friday nights. Bob
.. invites John to visit the RedDawn website and join. (Source: INTERVIEWEE)
.. 
.. Finding-The-Tournament
.. ----------------------
.. 
.. Bob is visiting his friend. He tries to use his friend's computer to log onto the RedDawn
.. SuperShooter tournament. But, he does not remember the exact name of the server. So, he visits the
.. RedDawn clan website to find that information. (Source: PERSONNAME)

Performance and Capacity Needs
==============================

.. todo:: Briefly list the stakeholders' desired values for various aspects of the system capacity.
   If you have a good idea about averages or rates of increase, note that as well.

.. By the end of the first year of service, we should to reach the following system capacity:
.. 
.. * 50,000 user records in the clan website account database (rate: 50-500 new registrations each day)
.. * 1000 users browsing the web site any given time
.. * 1000 gaming clans
.. * 1000 members of a single clan (average: 8)
.. * 4 MB max disk space for each clan (average: 0.5 MB)
.. * 100 game vendors posting advertisements on the site
.. * 1000 actual advertisements in the database
