Use Case Suite
==============

.. note:: A use case suite is simply a table of contents for the individual use cases. Much like a
   test suite, organizing the suite of use cases by priority, functional area, actor, business
   object, or release can help identify parts of the system that need additional use cases.

.. todo:: Before writing individual use cases, list the use cases that you think you will need.
   Organize them in a way that will purposely leave visible blanks on this page if you are missing
   use cases. E.g., see "Scalability and availability". Choose one or more of the organizations show
   below.

.. note:: Refer back to the user stories in your user needs document. Use them for ideas and make
   sure that you cover all of them. Remember that use cases are more precise than user stories, and
   there may be several use cases for a given user story.

.. note:: The use case suite can be organized into nested lists according to other coverage
   criteria, e.g., by actor. Or, it can be organized into tables that consider two aspects at a
   time, e.g., business objects vs. actor. If a certain section of the tree or table does not need
   use cases, explicitly mark it "N/A". Otherwise, mark it "TODO".
