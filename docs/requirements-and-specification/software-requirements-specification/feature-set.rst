Feature Set
===========

.. note:: A feature set is simply a table of contents for the individual feature descriptions. Much
   like a test suite, organizing the feature set by priority, functional area, actor, business
   object, or release can help identify missing, extra, or poorly motivated features early.

.. todo:: Before writing individual feature descriptions, list all the features that you think you
   will need. Organize them so that missing features appear as blanks on this page, and extra
   features will appear to be extras that don't fit anywhere. See the feature format document for
   more tips on specifying features and feature sets.

.. note:: Refer back to the user stories in your user needs document and to the use case suite. Use
   them for ideas and make sure that you cover all of them.

Features by Release and Priority
================================

.. todo:: Select subset of features can be implemented for a given release. When features are
   listed in priority order, choosing the features to implement in a release simply becomes a matter
   of "drawing a line": features below the line must wait for a later release. Make sure to also
   consider estimated effort and risk.
