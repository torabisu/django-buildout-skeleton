Potential Downside
==================

.. todo:: Could anyone be harmed or put at a disadvantage because of your system? List as above.
   Note, these are not risks to the success of your implementation, assume that you build the system
   as specified on time.

.. * Privacy
.. 
..    * When players opt into clans, they also opt into receiving marketing information from game
..      vendors. Usually this is a good thing if the players are interested, but it can also be
..      annoying.
..    * Cheaters will be publicly named as cheaters and blocked from game servers, thus they lose the
..      ability to play/cheat.
